# Self-organizing neuromorphic networks as stochastic dynamical systems

This repository contains the code for modeling self-organizing neuromorphic network of nanowires as stochastic dynamical system. This code has been exploited in the work "Self-organizing neuromorphic nanowire networks are stochastic dynamical systems"

Given an initial condition, the model provides the evolution over time of the neuromorophic network in terms of conductance, allowing to investigate both deterministic and stochastic dynamics.

The model requires the Python module BPL (https://up-rs-esp.github.io/bpl/).
